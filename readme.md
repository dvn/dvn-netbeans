# Dataverse Network (DVN) Development Environment

"The Dataverse Network is an open source application to publish, share, reference, extract and analyze research data." -- http://thedata.org

## What is this?

This git repo allows you to practice setting up a Dataverse Network (DVN) development environment on a virtual machine (VM) on your computer by following http://dvn.github.com/dvn-sourceforge2github/dvn-dev-on-github/quickstart/

Please note: the Vagrant part of this is not fully automated. Due to changes between CentOS 6.3 and 6.4, you must make sure the packages you get when installing GNOME are from 6.3.

The VM will be running CentOS 6 and we will be installing:

- NetBeans
- GlassFish
- and more...

More to come! This repo is forked from https://github.com/dvn/dvn-install-demo and needs to be cleaned up...

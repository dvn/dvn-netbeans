# Dataverse Network (DVN) Development Environment

"The Dataverse Network is an open source application to publish, share, reference, extract and analyze research data." -- http://thedata.org

## What is this?

This git repo allows you to practice setting up a Dataverse Network (DVN) development environment on a virtual machine (VM) on your computer.

The VM will be running CentOS 6 and we will be installing:

- NetBeans
- GlassFish
- and more...

More to come! This repo is forked from https://github.com/dvn/dvn-install-demo and needs to be cleaned up...
